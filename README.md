# Defense-Security-Systems
Hey! Welcome to my Defense and Security Systems' Insights Repository. GCC has been heavily reliant on imports; Hence, data of imports of military equipment is highly reliable for Defense and Security Systems RD organizations in the region to identify relevant opportunities to grow. Import data shows much of what the warfighter needs on the battlefield. Hence, the visualizations in this repository could be used as a starting point to; (a) direct an organization's long-term strategy, (b) evaluate current projects in the pipeline and develop a framework to redirect initiatives towards meaningful growth 

## Overview of GCC military eqipment imports
This visualization provides an overview of the imports in each category sorted by the number of contracts done by each region in the GCC. Furthermore, the dashboard provides an overview of Kingdom imports and top suppliers of each category sorted by the number of contracts done.
### GCC

### Accelerating Vision 2030- A Guide for devising Capabilities Roadmap for RD Centres in the Kingdom
#### Missile
Guided bomb and Anti-Missile tank are the biggest categories and BVRAAM and ABM are the smallest missile categories according to number of import contracts. RD centers in the Kingdom should look into acquiring talent to steer focus towards developing: 
- Paveway, JDAM & AGM-154 JSOW in the Guided Bomb Missile Category.
- BGM71 TOW, AGM-114L HELLFIRE in the Anti-Tank Missile Category.
- Shadow/SCALP in the ASM Category.
- AIM-120C AMRAAM in the BVRAAM Category.

#### Amplifying network strength
A smart manufacturing ecosystem can be created when all entities namely; production, supply chain, customer, and talent come together to solve shared challenges and meet shared objectives. As RD centers fall under the 'Production' node in a national defense network, such insights could help garner a starting point to gain a wholistic view and fuel the Kingdom towards achieving national sovereignty.
